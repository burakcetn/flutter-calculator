# calculator

A new Flutter calculator project for learning flutter fundamentals

## Getting Started

- This project isn't design as a responsive. Maybe later, this feature can be added to project.
- It is working well on 14 pro max
- +/- feature is bugged right now. I will work for it when i have freetime.
- AC button is working in two ways ;
   onTap: delete the user input one by one
   onLongPressed: delete all the user input and answer
